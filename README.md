# RideOrDie
Fast-paced action game made in Godot for the GMTK Game Jam 2022. I worked as part of a team for this game jam.

The theme of the game jam was 'Roll of the dice', so to fulfil this, we created a prototype of a level which was completable in several different ways. Before the level starts, a die is rolled and the value it lands on determines what character the user will play. Each character has a unique ability that helps it traverse the level in different ways. For example, one character can pick up heavy objects, which they can throw at certain 'weak' walls to destroy them, opening new paths through the level. The box can also be used to break line of sight with enemies.
